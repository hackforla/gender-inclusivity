<h3 id="what-is-gender">What is gender?</h3>

<p>The term gender refers to the economic, social and cultural attributes and opportunities associated with being male, female, transgender, etc. Many societies have different expectations about how people of different genders should dress, behave, work, love, marry, raise families, and participate in the society and its culture. Re</p>

<h3 id="how-is-gender-different-from-sex">How is gender different from sex?</h3>

<p>Gender differs from sex in that gender is social and cultural in nature, and sex is biological. Gender attributes and characteristics, encompassing, inter alia, the roles that people of different genders play, and the expectations placed upon the people, vary widely among societies and change over time. But the fact that gender attributes are socially constructed means that they are also amenable to change in ways that can make a society more just and equitable.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-gender-equity">What is gender equity?</h3>

<p>Gender equity is the process of being fair to all people, regardless of gender, such as male, female, transgender, agender, etc. Gender equity is linked to sustainable development and is vital to the realization of human rights for all. The overall objective of gender equity is a society in which all people enjoy the same opportunities, rights, and obligations, in all spheres of life, regardless of gender.</p>

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>

<p>We are creating a web tool that searches websites for gender-exclusive words and suggests gender-inclusive words. For example, you can search for the gender-exclusive word “fireman”, and the tool will find it, and suggest the gender-inclusive word “firefighter”.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h3>

<p>We welcome help and constructive criticism. Here are some ways to parcipated.</p>

<ul>

    <li><p>Join the team at Hack For LA. We meet on Tuesday evenings downtown, and we keep in touch during the week via remote tools like Slack and Zoom.</p></li>

    <li><p>Share your opinion about what words you want to search. We are currently experimenting with words on this <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/gender-inclusive-language">list</a>, and we anticipate that many people may want to create their own lists of words.</p></li>
